Hello!

This is CoreCity. A website that was made for a Web Development class in Fall 2024. The final project was to create a 'business management system' that asked for the user
to create a website that allows for user, staff, and admin login. In addition to that, it also involves the use of databases and should make requests to it when the time calls for something
such as deleting the user. The project was originally meant to be done in groups of three but due to scheduling errors and unfortunately issues regarding work distribution, I was left
to work on the project by myself, which is all to say that unfortunately not all of the ideal features have been implemented.

To give a quick summary of the website thus far, it is meant to serve as a website for a gym located in Detroit (the location was picked at random). It was made using HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and also XAMPP.It allows for user login and registration. It also makes use of various roles, stuch as Users, Staff, and Admin (each also having their 
own respective databases). Users are able to schedule appointments with Staff members who can then decide whether they wish to cancel or delete the appointment. In addition to that, 
Users can file reports if they've witnessed any issues at the gym, and Staff can view them. Admin have the most features built in, which allows them to remove 
Users and Staff Members, and it also allows them to edit Users and Staff. In addition to that, Admin can also resolve/remove any reports made by users. The system also allows for 
the user to submit a profile picture upon registration or whenever they find the need to edit their profile. 

There's still plenty to improve upon for this project. However, to test with it, you should be able to find two separate README files which will explain how the code works and also what
queries to submit for the database.
