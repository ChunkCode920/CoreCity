# CORE CITY

Core City is a web development project made during my senior year. The purpose of this project is to act as a gym website that allows users to register for an account. Users for the website are divided into Users, Staff, and Admin. All aforementioned roles have their own set tasks and limitations. Included in this repo are the files needed to run this website/project.

## Prerequisites 
Once the files have been downloaded, you'll need to download XAMPP on your device and place the project file into: \xampp\htdocs folder. XAMPP should be running at this time and it is useful to have a tab open for phpMyAdmin so you can see any possible database changes made.


### Languages/Technologies Used
As mentioned previously, XAMPP was used as well as a whole host of programming/scripting languages. The current list includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, and SQL. I got to learn how to use SQL databases from a simple command line and also the more user-friendly GUI interface provided by phpMyAdmin. 

### Extra Information
In addition to the code provided in the project folder, there are also sample photos that can be used for User/Staff/Admin profile pictures. Included in the files are also SQL queries to create tables for Users/Staff/Admin and for uploading sample Staff and Admin for testers to login with. 

## Lessons Learned
I learned that making a website was equally as difficult as I thought it was, but in plenty of ways it was much simpler than I realized. Working with a database was probably one of my favorite parts of the project because I actually got to learn how account information was actually made and stored into a database. Furthermore, it also taught me how passwords that users have chosen are placed into a cipher to protect them in case of an emergency situation where the database has been breached. 

While making this project, I also recognized one of the glaring issues I ran into was creating a proper organizational structure. It's safe to say that there's still plenty of work I could have done on that end but making this project help to highlight that issue.
