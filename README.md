# CORE CITY

Core City is a web development project made during my senior year. The purpose of this project is to act as a gym website that allows users to register for an account. Users for the website are divided into Users, Staff, and Admin. All aforementioned roles have their own set tasks and limitations. Included in this repo are the files needed to run this website/project.

## Prerequisites 
Once the files have been downloaded, you'll need to download XAMPP on your device and place the project file into: \xampp\htdocs folder. XAMPP should be running at this time and it is useful to have a tab open for phpMyAdmin so you can see any possible database changes made.

### Extra Information
In addition to the code provided in the project folder, there are also sample photos that can be used for User/Staff/Admin profile pictures. Included in the files are also SQL queries to create tables for Users/Staff/Admin and for uploading sample Staff and Admin for testers to login with.
