CORE CITY

Synopsis: Core City is a final project for a Web Development class during the Fall Semester of 2024. It was made by myself and allows for users to sign up and create their own accounts, schedule appointments, edit their accounts, and a variety of other features. The languages and technologies used for this project were XAMPP/MAMP (for Mac), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Boostrap.

Download: Included within the Core City file are an assortment of test files that should ideally run the entire project. It is recommended to have XAMPP downloaded and set up before uploading the project within the main folder. In addition to that, there are README files within various folders that describe all the necessary SQL statements to use to upload the images.
